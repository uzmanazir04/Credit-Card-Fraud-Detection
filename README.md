# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The aim of this project is to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. It aims to track down credit card transaction data, which is done by detecting anomalies in the transaction data. Credit card fraud detection is typically implemented using an algorithm that detects any anomalies in the transaction data and notifies the cardholder (as a precautionary measure) and the bank about any suspicious transaction.
To build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent transactions. We will use a variety of machine learning algorithms that will be able to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent one. By the end of this machine learning project, you will learn how to implement machine learning algorithms to perform classification.
